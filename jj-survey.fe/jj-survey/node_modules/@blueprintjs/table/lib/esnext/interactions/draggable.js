 * This component provides a simple interface for combined drag and/or click
 * events.
 *
 * Since the mouse interactions for drag and click are overloaded, here are
 * the events that will fire in these cases:
 *
 * A Click Interaction
 * 1. The user presses down on the render element, triggering the onActivate
 *    callback.
 * 2. The user releases the mouse button without moving it, triggering the
 *    onClick callback.
 *
 * A Drag Interaction
 * 1. The user presses down on the render element, triggering the onActivate
 *    callback.
 * 2. The user moves the mouse, triggering the onDragMove callback.
 * 3. The user moves the mouse, triggering the onDragMove callback.
 * 4. The user moves the mouse, triggering the onDragMove callback.
 * 5. The user releases the mouse button, triggering a final onDragMove
 *    callback as well as an onDragEnd callback.
 *
 * If `false` is returned from the onActivate callback, no further events
 * will be fired until the next activation.
